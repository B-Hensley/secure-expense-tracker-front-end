## Security Measures

This project follows basic security best practices, including:

- **Helmet.js**: Used to set security-related HTTP headers and mitigate common vulnerabilities.
- **No Authentication**: Currently, the front-end does not implement authentication.
- **No RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: There is no role-based access control in place.
